                <p>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</p>
                <p>
                    I am Josh and I have been working with IT since about 2015.
                    I am passionate about IT and aspire to enhance my skills as
                    I explore the endless possibilities it has to offer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have developed a love of Web Development and Cyber
                    Security recently and hope I can pursue those areas in the
                    future, but as it's a bit more difficult to show, I will be
                    creating mostly web projects here, or anything else that may
                    interest me at the time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Feel free to have a look anytime at my projects, or
                    <a href="https://github.com/supasonic007">GitHub page</a>
                    for updates on myself and my projects. You can also go view
                    the site I had previously
                    <a href="https://joush007.github.io">joush007.github.io</a>
                    (Yes I know I have 3 different names across these
                    profiles/websites, but I am now sticking with joshey007)
                    which contains everything I did before graduating, including
                    my 3 largest projects during school. The links to projects
                    may not work as I transferred the projects to the account
                    that this page links to.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My most recent project can be found
                    <a href="https://dnd.joshey007.dev">here</a>!
