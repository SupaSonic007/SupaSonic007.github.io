            <p>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</p>
            <p>
                I am Josh and I have been working with IT since about 2015. I am
                passionate about IT and aspire to enhance my skills as I explore
                the endless possibilities it has to offer.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have developed a love of Web Development and Cyber Security
                recently and hope I can pursue those areas in the future, but as
                it's a bit more difficult to show, I will be creating mostly web
                projects here, or anything else that may interest me at the
                time.
            </p>

            <p>
                Feel free to have a look anytime at my projects, or
                <a href="https://github.com/supasonic007">GitHub page</a> for
                updates on myself and my projects. You can also go view the site
                I had previously
                <a href="https://joush007.github.io">joush007.github.io</a> (Yes
                I know I have 3 different names across these profiles/websites,
                but I am now sticking with joshey007) which contains everything
                I did before graduating, including my 3 largest projects during
                school. The links to projects may not work as I transferred the
                projects to the account that this page links to.
            </p>

                The github page for this page can be found
                <a href="https://github.com/SupaSonic007">here</a> and my most
                recent project can be found
